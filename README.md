# cool-arduino-projects
Hello! This is a repo featuring small, beginner friendly arduino projects! This will only contain mine at first, but anyone can always commit their own small projects! To build, follow the instructions in the INO files!


**NOTICE - Most of these were designed with an arduino MEGA2560, not the uno, which is why the pin numbers are ginormous. However, if you have enough pins, changing the pin numbers should work just fine.**
