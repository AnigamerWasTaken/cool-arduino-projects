# cool-arduino-projects
Hello! This is a repo featuring small arduino projects! This will only contain mine at first, but anyone can always commit their own small projects!


NOTICE - Most of these were designed with an arduino MEGA2560, not the uno, which is why the pin numbers are ginormous. However, if you have enough pins, changing the pin numbers should work just fine.
